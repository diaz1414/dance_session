**Framework:** QBCore/ESX/Standalone  
**Menu:** ox_lib  
**Notification:** Choose between QBCore, ESX, or ox_lib (see `config.lua`)

## Description
This script allows players to create synchronized dance sessions:  
- The host creates a session and selects a dance.  
- Players can join and follow the hostâ€™s animation.  
- Stop dance, leave session, or end session.  
- Auto-kick members when they disconnect, and auto-end if the host disconnects.

## Features
- `/createsession` â†’ Create a new session  
- `/opendance` â†’ Host chooses dance (ox_lib menu)  
- `/joindance [id]` â†’ Join an existing session  
- `/leavedance` â†’ Leave the session  
- `/stopdance` â†’ Stop dance (host stops for all, members stop their own)  
- `/endsession` â†’ Host ends the session  
- Flexible notification system (QBCore / ESX / ox_lib)  
- Auto-kick on disconnect
